      "I've been playing this game since release, and it used to be a blast. From initial release in February 2019 to about 6-9 months after Valkyrie’s release (~ early 2022), it was incredible. But not soon after this, it began its slow, agonizing decline into the utter disaster it is today. And we all know why: it’s thanks to the absolute trainwreck of a company known as EA (or as I like to call them, Electronic Arseholes).\n",
      "\n",
      "The matchmaking? A joke. The server and connection issues? Relentless. Cheating and exploiting have become so rampant it feels like a rigged game at this point. EA’s \"brilliant\" solution to these issues? Nothing. Absolutely nothing. They sit on their hands while the game crumbles beneath their feet.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Battle Pass changes? Just another example of EA's contempt for its players. Instead of addressing the fundamental problems, they milk their loyal fanbase dry, squeezing every last cent out of them. And for what? A broken, glitch-ridden mess that barely resembles the game it once was.\n",
      "\n",
      "Oh, and let's talk about the reviews. Over 12,000 overwhelmingly negative reviews—are they all wrong? No, they’re a testament to the absolute failure of this game and its developers. Player counts are scraping the bottom of the barrel, almost as low as when the game first launched. And that’s after four years!\n",
      "\n",
      "You'd think that would send a message to EA, but no, they’re too busy with their heads shoved so far up their corporate butts that they can't even begin to see or smell the steaming pile of garbage their game has become.\n",

      "Electronic Arseholes, you've outdone yourselves.\n",
